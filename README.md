DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT, hereafter) is a very powerful client/server system
that has been written for a very specific purpose, for a very specific clientele.

It is designed to track and locate Narcotics Anonymous meetings, which are regularly-scheduled, weekly, recurring events.

The original intended clientele is Narcotics Anonymous Service bodies (although other 12 step fellowships have started
using BMLT as well). The service body implements a BMLT server, and provides the server to other NA Service bodies.
This project is the server for the BMLT. It is the "server" part of the BMLT "client/server" architecture.

You can find out more about the BMLT on the [website](https://bmlt.app).

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The server requires Apache2 (with the `php` and `rewrite` mods loaded and `AllowOverride All` for the document root directory), MySQL 5.7 database or higher (with communication enabled via localhost network not just sockets), and PHP 8.3 or higher (with installed modules `curl`, `gd`, `intl`, `mbstring`, `mysql`, `dom`, `xml`, and `zip`). There are a variety of MySQL modules for PHP, and others will probably work as a substitute for `mysql`. If you see a "500 Server Error" page in your browser when you first try to access a newly installed server, it's probably because you're missing one of these modules or settings.

For more information about server requirements, see the "Things You Will Need Before You Install" section of
[Installing a New Server](https://bmlt.app/setting-up-the-bmlt/).
 
INSTALLATION
